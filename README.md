# Cache Line Profiler Guide

## Prerequisites
To use this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **CUDA Toolkit**: A suite of tools necessary to develop applications for NVIDIA GPUs.
- **A CUDA-capable GPU**: Hardware capable of executing parallel operations using CUDA.
- **GNU Make**: A tool which controls the generation of executables from the program's source files.

## How to Use the Makefile
The included Makefile simplifies the process of compiling and running the CUDA programs. Below are the commands you can use:

### Compile All Programs
To compile the CUDA program `cache_line_profiler_3.cu`, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the `.cu` file into an executable.

### Run All Programs
To execute the compiled program, use the following command:
```bash
make run
```

This will run the program with the specified data sizes.

### Generate Output File
To run the program and redirect its output to `output.txt` , use the following command:

```bash
make file
```

This command will execute the program and save its output, which is useful for further analysis or record-keeping.

### Clean Up
To remove the compiled executable, execute the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

This will clean up your project directory by deleting the executable file generated by the Makefile, maintaining a tidy workspace.
